# Typings for [Discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js)

These typings are included in the Discord.js repo and packages as a submodule as of v11 and will should be automatically available in your editor after installing Discord.js.  
If you have any issues getting them to load, feel free to open up an issue on this repo and we'll try to get it sorted out.

Don't forget to install typings for Node!
```bash
npm install @types/node
```

These typings are hand-written so if you notice any inconsistencies with the typings based on the matching version's docs open an issue and let us know.
