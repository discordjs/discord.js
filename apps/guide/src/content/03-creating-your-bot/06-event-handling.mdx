# Event handling

Node.js uses an event-driven architecture, making it possible to execute code when a specific event occurs. The discord.js library takes full advantage of this. You can visit the <DocsLink type="class" parent="Client" /> documentation to see the full list of events.

::: tip
This page assumes you've followed the guide up to this point, and created your _`index.js`_ and individual slash commands according to those pages.
:::

At this point, your `index.js` file has code for loading commands, and listeners for two events: `ClientReady` and `InteractionCreate`.

<CH.Code>

```js Command loading
const commands = new Collection();

const commandsPath = fileURLToPath(new URL('commands', import.meta.url));
const commandFiles = await readdir(commandsPath).then((files) => files.filter((file) => file.endsWith('.js')));

for (const file of commandFiles) {
	const filePath = join(commandsPath, file);
	const command = await import(filePath);
	// Set a new item in the Collection with the key as the command name and the value as the exported module
	if ('data' in command && 'execute' in command) {
		commands.set(command.data.name, command);
	} else {
		console.log(`[WARNING] The command at ${filePath} is missing a required "data" or "execute" property.`);
	}
}
```

```js ClientReady
client.once(Events.ClientReady, (c) => {
	console.log(`Ready! Logged in as ${c.user.tag}`);
});
```

```js InteractionCreate
client.on(Events.InteractionCreate, async (interaction) => {
	if (!interaction.isChatInputCommand()) return;

	const command = commands.get(interaction.commandName);

	if (!command) {
		console.error(`No command matching ${interaction.commandName} was found.`);
		return;
	}

	try {
		await command.execute(interaction);
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(`Error executing ${interaction.commandName}`);
		console.error(error);
	}
});
```

</CH.Code>

Currently, all of this code is in the _`index.js`_ file. <DocsLink type="class" parent="Client" symbol="e-ready" /> emits once when the _`Client`_ becomes ready for use, and <DocsLink type="class" parent="Client" symbol="e-interactionCreate" /> emits whenever an interaction is received.
Moving the event listener code into individual files is simple, and we'll be taking a similar approach to the [command handler](/creating-your-bot/command-handling.md).

## Individual event files

Your project directory should look something like this:

```
discord-bot/
├── commands/
├── node_modules/
├── config.json
├── deploy-commands.js
├── index.js
├── package-lock.json
└── package.json
```

Create an _`events`_ folder in the same directory. You can then move the code from your event listeners in _`index.js`_ to separate files: _`events/ready.js`_ and _`events/interactionCreate.js`_. The _`InteractionCreate`_ event is responsible for command handling, so the command loading code will move here too.

<CH.Code>

```js events/ready.js
import { Events } from 'discord.js';

export const name = Events.ClientReady;
export const once = true;
export async function execute(client) {
	console.log(`Ready! Logged in as ${client.user.tag}`);
}
```

```js events/interactionCreate.js
import { readdir } from 'node:fs/promises';
import { join } from 'node:path';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';
import { Collection, Events } from 'discord.js';

const commands = new Collection();

const foldersPath = fileURLToPath(new URL('commands', import.meta.url));
const commandFolders = await readdir(foldersPath);

for (const folder of commandFolders) {
	const commandsPath = join(foldersPath, folder);
	const commandFiles = await readdir(commandsPath).then((files) => files.filter((file) => file.endsWith('.js')));
	for (const file of commandFiles) {
		const filePath = join(commandsPath, file);
		const command = await import(filePath);
		// Set a new item in the Collection with the key as the command name and the value as the exported module
		if ('data' in command && 'execute' in command) {
			commands.set(command.data.name, command);
		} else {
			console.log(`[WARNING] The command at ${filePath} is missing a required "data" or "execute" property.`);
		}
	}
}

export const name = Events.InteractionCreate;
export async function execute(interaction) {
	if (!interaction.isChatInputCommand()) return;

	const command = commands.get(interaction.commandName);

	if (!command) {
		console.error(`No command matching ${interaction.commandName} was found.`);
		return;
	}

	try {
		await command.execute(interaction);
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(`Error executing ${interaction.commandName}`);
		console.error(error);
	}
}
```

```js index.js
import { readdir } from 'node:fs/promises';
import { join } from 'node:path';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';
import { Client, GatewayIntentBits } from 'discord.js';
import config from './config.json' assert { type: 'json' };

const client = new Client({ intents: [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds] });

client.login(config.token);
```

</CH.Code>

The _`name`_ property states which event this file is for, and the _`once`_ property holds a boolean value that specifies if the event should run only once. You don't need to specify this in _`interactionCreate.js`_ as the default behavior will be to run on every event instance. The _`execute`_ function holds your event logic, which will be called by the event handler whenever the event emits.

## Reading event files

Next, let's write the code for dynamically retrieving all the event files in the _`events`_ folder. We'll be taking a similar approach to our [command handler](/creating-your-bot/command-handling.md). Place the new code highlighted below in your _`index.js`_.

_`fs.readdir()`_ combined with _`array.filter()`_ returns an array of all the file names in the given directory and filters for only _`.js`_ files, i.e. `['ready.js', 'interactionCreate.js']`.

<CH.Code>

```js focus=26:37
import { readdir } from 'node:fs/promises';
import { join } from 'node:path';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';
import { Client, GatewayIntentBits } from 'discord.js';
import config from './config.json' assert { type: 'json' };

const client = new Client({ intents: [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds] });

const eventsPath = fileURLToPath(new URL('events', import.meta.url));
const eventFiles = await readdir(eventsPath).then((files) => files.filter((file) => file.endsWith('.js')));

for (const file of eventFiles) {
	const filePath = join(eventsPath, file);
	const event = await import(filePath);
	if (event.once) {
		client.once(event.name, (...args) => event.execute(...args));
	} else {
		client.on(event.name, (...args) => event.execute(...args));
	}
}

client.login(config.token);
```

</CH.Code>

You'll notice the code looks very similar to the command loading above it - read the files in the events folder and load each one individually.

The <DocsLink type="class" parent="Client" /> class in discord.js extends the [`EventEmitter`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter) class. Therefore, the _`client`_ object exposes the [`.on()`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_emitter_on_eventname_listener) and [`.once()`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_emitter_once_eventname_listener) methods that you can use to register event listeners. These methods take two arguments: the event name and a callback function. These are defined in your separate event files as _`name`_ and _`execute`_.

The callback function passed takes argument(s) returned by its respective event, collects them in an _`args`_ array using the _`...`_ [rest parameter syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters), then calls _`event.execute()`_ while passing in the _`args`_ array using the _`...`_ [spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax). They are used here because different events in discord.js have different numbers of arguments. The rest parameter collects these variable number of arguments into a single array, and the spread syntax then takes these elements and passes them to the _`execute`_ function.

After this, listening for other events is as easy as creating a new file in the _`events`_ folder. The event handler will automatically retrieve and register it whenever you restart your bot.

<Alert title="Tip" type="success">
	In most cases, you can access your _`client`_ instance in other files by obtaining it from one of the other discord.js
	structures, e.g. _`interaction.client`_ in the _`InteractionCreate`_ event. You do not need to manually pass it to
	your events.
