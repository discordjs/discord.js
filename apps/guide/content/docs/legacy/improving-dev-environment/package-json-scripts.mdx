## Setting up package.json scripts

An easy way to run scripts like a script to start your bot, a script to lint your bot's files, or whatever scripts you use is by storing them in your `package.json` file. After you store these scripts in your `package.json` file, you can run the `start` script to start your bot or the `lint` script to lint your code for errors.

```sh tab="npm"
npm run start
npm run lint
```

```sh tab="yarn"
yarn run start
yarn run lint
```

```sh tab="pnpm"
pnpm run start
pnpm run lint
```

```sh tab="bun"
bun run start
bun run lint
```

## Getting started

<Callout>
Before getting started, you'll need to have a `package.json` file. If you don't have a `package.json` file yet, you can run the following command in the console to generate one.

```sh tab="npm"
npm init -y
```

```sh tab="yarn"
yarn init -y
```

```sh tab="pnpm"
pnpm init
```

```sh tab="bun"
bun init -y
```

</Callout>

If you haven't touched your `package.json` file yet (excluding installing dependencies), your `package.json` file should look similar to the following:

```json title="package.json"
{
	"name": "my-bot",
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"description": "A Discord bot!",
	"main": "index.js",
	"scripts": {
		"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
	},
	"keywords": [],
	"author": "",
	"license": "ISC"
}
```

Let's zoom in more. Below `main`, you'll see `scripts`. You can specify your scripts there. In this guide, we'll show how to start and lint your bot using a `package.json` script.

## Adding your first script

<Callout>
	We'll assume you have finished the [creating your app](../app-creation/project-setup) section of the guide. If you
	haven't, ensure to follow it first!
</Callout>

Over at your `package.json` file, add the following line to the `scripts`:

```json title="package.json"
{
	"name": "my-bot",
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"description": "A Discord bot!",
	"main": "index.js",
	"scripts": { // [!code focus:5]
		"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1" // needs a comma // [!code --]
		"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1", // [!code ++]
		"start": "node ." // [!code ++]
	},
	"keywords": [],
	"author": "",
	"license": "ISC"
}
```

<Callout>
	The `node .` script will run the file you have specified at the `main` entry in your `package.json` file. If you don't
	have it set yet, make sure to select your bot's main file as `main`!
</Callout>

Now, whenever you run the `start` script in your bot's directory, it will run the `node .` command.

```sh tab="npm"
npm run start
```

```sh tab="yarn"
yarn run start
```

```sh tab="pnpm"
pnpm run start
```

```sh tab="bun"
bun run start
```

Let's create another script to lint your code via the command line. Add the following line to your scripts:

```json title="package.json"
{
	"name": "my-bot",
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"description": "A Discord bot!",
	"main": "index.js",
	"scripts": { // [!code focus:6]
		"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
		"start": "node ." // needs a comma // [!code --]
		"start": "node .", // [!code ++]
		"lint": "eslint ." // [!code ++]
	},
	"keywords": [],
	"author": "",
	"license": "ISC"
}
```

Now, whenever you run the `lint` script, ESLint will lint your `index.js` file.

```sh tab="npm"
npm run lint
```

```sh tab="yarn"
yarn run lint
```

```sh tab="pnpm"
pnpm run lint
```

```sh tab="bun"
bun run lint
```

Your `package.json` file should now look similar to the following:

```json
{
	"name": "my-bot",
	"version": "1.0.0",
	"description": "A Discord bot!",
	"main": "index.js",
	"scripts": {
		"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
		"start": "node .",
		"lint": "eslint ."
	},
	"keywords": [],
	"author": "",
	"license": "ISC"
}
```

And that's it! You can always add more scripts now, running them with:

```sh tab="npm"
npm run <script-name>
```

```sh tab="yarn"
yarn run <script-name>
```

```sh tab="pnpm"
pnpm run <script-name>
```

```sh tab="bun"
bun run <script-name>
```
