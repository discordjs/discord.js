title: Command Handling
---

import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

Unless your bot project is small, it's not a very good idea to have a single file with a giant `if`/`else if` chain for commands. If you want to implement features into your bot and make your development process a lot less painful, you'll want to implement a command handler. Let's get started on that!

For fully functional slash commands, you need three important pieces of code:

<Steps>
<Step>

### Command Files

The individual command files, containing [slash command](./creating-commands) definitions and functionality.

</Step>
<Step>

### Command Handler

The command handler, dynamically reads the command files and executes commands.

</Step>
<Step>

### Command Deployment

The command [deployment script](./deploying-commands) to register your slash commands with Discord.

</Step>
</Steps>

These steps can be followed in any order, but are all required to make your bot work. This page details step **2**. Make sure you also check out the other linked pages.

## Loading command files

Now that your command files have been created, your bot needs to load these files on startup.

In your `index.js` file, make these additions to the base template:

```js title="index.js" lineNumbers
// [!code ++:4]
const fs = require('node:fs');
const path = require('node:path');
const { Client, Collection, Events, GatewayIntentBits, MessageFlags } = require('discord.js');
const { token } = require('./config.json');

const client = new Client({ intents: [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds] });

client.once(Events.ClientReady, (readyClient) => {
	console.log(`Ready! Logged in as ${readyClient.user.tag}`);
});

client.commands = new Collection(); // [!code ++]
```

We recommend attaching a `.commands` property to your client instance so that you can access your commands in other files. The rest of the examples in this guide will follow this convention. For TypeScript users, we recommend extending the base Client class to add this property, [casting](https://www.typescripttutorial.net/typescript-tutorial/type-casting/), or [augmenting the module type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#module-augmentation).

<Callout>
	- The [`fs`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) module is Node's native file system module. `fs` is used to read the
	`commands` directory and identify our command files. - The [`path`](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html) module is Node's
	native path utility module. `path` helps construct paths to access files and directories. One of the advantages of the
	`path` module is that it automatically detects the operating system and uses the appropriate joiners. - The
	`Collection` class extends JavaScript's native
	[`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) class, and includes more
	extensive, useful functionality. `Collection` is used to store and efficiently retrieve commands for execution.
</Callout>

Next, using the modules imported above, dynamically retrieve your command files with a few more additions to the `index.js` file:

```js title="index.js" lineNumbers=12
client.commands = new Collection();

const foldersPath = path.join(__dirname, 'commands');
const commandFolders = fs.readdirSync(foldersPath);

for (const folder of commandFolders) {
	const commandsPath = path.join(foldersPath, folder);
	const commandFiles = fs.readdirSync(commandsPath).filter((file) => file.endsWith('.js'));
	for (const file of commandFiles) {
		const filePath = path.join(commandsPath, file);
		const command = require(filePath);
		// Set a new item in the Collection with the key as the command name and the value as the exported module
		if ('data' in command && 'execute' in command) {
			client.commands.set(command.data.name, command);
		} else {
			console.log(`[WARNING] The command at ${filePath} is missing a required "data" or "execute" property.`);
		}
	}
}
```

First, [`path.join()`](https://nodejs.org/api/path.html#pathjoinpaths) helps to construct a path to the `commands` directory. The first [`fs.readdirSync()`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readdirsync_path_options) method then reads the path to the directory and returns an array of all the folder names it contains, currently `['utility']`. The second `fs.readdirSync()` method reads the path to this directory and returns an array of all the file names they contain, currently `['ping.js', 'server.js', 'user.js']`. To ensure only command files get processed, `Array.filter()` removes any non-JavaScript files from the array.

With the correct files identified, the last step is dynamically set each command into the `client.commands` Collection. For each file being loaded, check that it has at least the `data` and `execute` properties. This helps to prevent errors resulting from loading empty, unfinished, or otherwise incorrect command files while you're still developing.

## Receiving command interactions

You will receive an interaction for every slash command executed. To respond to a command, you need to create a listener for the `interactionCreate` event that will execute code when your application receives an interaction. Place the code below in the `index.js` file you created earlier.

```js title="index.js" lineNumbers=32
// [!code ++:3]
client.on(Events.InteractionCreate, (interaction) => {
	console.log(interaction);
});
```

Not every interaction is a slash command (e.g. `MessageComponent` interactions). Make sure to only handle slash commands in this function by making use of the `BaseInteraction#isChatInputCommand` method to exit the handler if another type is encountered. This method also provides typeguarding for TypeScript users, narrowing the type from `BaseInteraction` to a `ChatInputCommandInteraction`.

```js title="index.js" lineNumbers=32
client.on(Events.InteractionCreate, (interaction) => {
	if (!interaction.isChatInputCommand()) return; // [!code ++]
	console.log(interaction);
});
```

## Executing commands

When your bot receives a `interactionCreate` event, the interaction object contains all the information you need to dynamically retrieve and execute your commands!

Let's take a look at the `ping` command again. Note the `execute()` function that will reply to the interaction with "Pong!".

```js title="commands/utility/ping.js"
// [!code word:execute]
module.exports = {
	data: new SlashCommandBuilder().setName('ping').setDescription('Replies with Pong!'),
	async execute(interaction) {
		await interaction.reply('Pong!');
	},
};
```

First, you need to get the matching command from the `client.commands` Collection based on the `interaction.commandName`. Your `Client` instance is always available via `interaction.client`. If no matching command is found, log an error to the console and ignore the event.

With the right command identified, all that's left to do is call the command's `.execute()` method and pass in the `interaction` variable as its argument. In case something goes wrong, catch and log any error to the console.

```js title="index.js" lineNumbers=32
client.on(Events.InteractionCreate, async (interaction) => {
	if (!interaction.isChatInputCommand()) return;
	// [!code ++:23]
	const command = interaction.client.commands.get(interaction.commandName);

	if (!command) {
		console.error(`No command matching ${interaction.commandName} was found.`);
		return;
	}

	try {
		await command.execute(interaction);
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(error);
		if (interaction.replied || interaction.deferred) {
			await interaction.followUp({
				content: 'There was an error while executing this command!',
				flags: MessageFlags.Ephemeral,
			});
		} else {
			await interaction.reply({
				content: 'There was an error while executing this command!',
				flags: MessageFlags.Ephemeral,
			});
		}
	}
});
```

#### Next steps

Your command files are now loaded into your bot, and the event listener is prepared and ready to respond. In the next section, we cover the final step: a command deployment script you'll need to register your commands so they appear in the Discord client.
