title: Event Handling

import { File, Folder, Files } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/files';

Node.js uses an event-driven architecture, making it possible to execute code when a specific event occurs. The discord.js library takes full advantage of this. You can visit the `Client` documentation to see the full list of events.

<Callout>
	This page assumes you've followed the guide up to this point, and created your `index.js` and individual slash
	commands according to those pages.
</Callout>

At this point, your `index.js` file has listeners for two events: `ClientReady` and `InteractionCreate`.

```js title="index.js"
// [!code word:ClientReady]
client.once(Events.ClientReady, (readyClient) => {
	console.log(`Ready! Logged in as ${readyClient.user.tag}`);

// [!code word:InteractionCreate]
client.on(Events.InteractionCreate, async (interaction) => {
	if (!interaction.isChatInputCommand()) return;

	const command = interaction.client.commands.get(interaction.commandName);

	if (!command) {
		console.error(`No command matching ${interaction.commandName} was found.`);
		return;
	}

	try {
		await command.execute(interaction);
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(error);
		if (interaction.replied || interaction.deferred) {
			await interaction.followUp({
				content: 'There was an error while executing this command!',
				flags: MessageFlags.Ephemeral,
			});
		} else {
			await interaction.reply({
				content: 'There was an error while executing this command!',
				flags: MessageFlags.Ephemeral,
			});
		}
	}
});
```

Currently, the event listeners are in the `index.js` file. `Client#ready`emits once when the `Client` becomes ready for use, and `Client#interactionCreate` emits whenever an interaction is received. Moving the event listener code into individual files is simple, and we'll be taking a similar approach to the command handler.

<Callout type="warn">
	You're only going to move these two events from `index.js`. The code for [loading command
	files](./handling-commands#loading-command-files) will stay here!
</Callout>

## Individual event files

Your project directory should look something like this:

<Files>
	<Folder name="discord-bot" defaultOpen>
		<Folder name="commands" defaultOpen />
		<Folder name="node_modules" defaultOpen />
		<File name="config.json" />
		<File name="deploy-commands.js" />
		<File name="index.js" />
		<File name="package-lock.json" />
		<File name="package.json" />
	</Folder>
</Files>

Create an `events` folder in the same directory. You can then move the code from your event listeners in `index.js` to separate files: `events/ready.js` and `events/interactionCreate.js`.

```js tab="Ready Handler" title="events/ready.js"
const { Events } = require('discord.js');

module.exports = {
	name: Events.ClientReady,
	once: true,
	execute(client) {
		console.log(`Ready! Logged in as ${client.user.tag}`);
	},
};
```

```js tab="Interaction Handler" title="events/interactionCreate.js"
const { Events, MessageFlags } = require('discord.js');

module.exports = {
	name: Events.InteractionCreate,
	async execute(interaction) {
		if (!interaction.isChatInputCommand()) return;

		const command = interaction.client.commands.get(interaction.commandName);

		if (!command) {
			console.error(`No command matching ${interaction.commandName} was found.`);
			return;
		}

		try {
			await command.execute(interaction);
		} catch (error) {
			console.error(error);
			if (interaction.replied || interaction.deferred) {
				await interaction.followUp({
					content: 'There was an error while executing this command!',
					flags: MessageFlags.Ephemeral,
				});
			} else {
				await interaction.reply({
					content: 'There was an error while executing this command!',
					flags: MessageFlags.Ephemeral,
				});
			}
		}
	},
};
```

```js title="index.js" tab="Main File (after removing events)"
const fs = require('node:fs');
const path = require('node:path');
const { Client, Collection, GatewayIntentBits } = require('discord.js');
const { token } = require('./config.json');

const client = new Client({ intents: [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds] });

client.commands = new Collection();
const foldersPath = path.join(__dirname, 'commands');
const commandFolders = fs.readdirSync(foldersPath);

for (const folder of commandFolders) {
	const commandsPath = path.join(foldersPath, folder);
	const commandFiles = fs.readdirSync(commandsPath).filter((file) => file.endsWith('.js'));
	for (const file of commandFiles) {
		const filePath = path.join(commandsPath, file);
		const command = require(filePath);
		if ('data' in command && 'execute' in command) {
			client.commands.set(command.data.name, command);
		} else {
			console.log(`[WARNING] The command at ${filePath} is missing a required "data" or "execute" property.`);
		}
	}
}

client.login(token);
```

The `name` property states which event this file is for, and the `once` property holds a boolean value that specifies if the event should run only once. You don't need to specify this in `interactionCreate.js` as the default behavior will be to run on every event instance. The `execute` function holds your event logic, which will be called by the event handler whenever the event emits.

## Reading event files

Next, let's write the code for dynamically retrieving all the event files in the `events` folder. We'll be taking a similar approach to our [command handler](./handling-commands). Place the new code highlighted below in your `index.js`.

`fs.readdirSync().filter()` returns an array of all the file names in the given directory and filters for only `.js` files, i.e. `['ready.js', 'interactionCreate.js']`.

```js title="index.js"
const fs = require('node:fs');
const path = require('node:path');
const { Client, Collection, GatewayIntentBits } = require('discord.js');
const { token } = require('./config.json');

const client = new Client({ intents: [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds] });

client.commands = new Collection();
const foldersPath = path.join(__dirname, 'commands');
const commandFolders = fs.readdirSync(foldersPath);

for (const folder of commandFolders) {
	const commandsPath = path.join(foldersPath, folder);
	const commandFiles = fs.readdirSync(commandsPath).filter((file) => file.endsWith('.js'));
	for (const file of commandFiles) {
		const filePath = path.join(commandsPath, file);
		const command = require(filePath);
		if ('data' in command && 'execute' in command) {
			client.commands.set(command.data.name, command);
		} else {
			console.log(`[WARNING] The command at ${filePath} is missing a required "data" or "execute" property.`);
		}
	}
}

// [!code ++:12]
const eventsPath = path.join(__dirname, 'events');
const eventFiles = fs.readdirSync(eventsPath).filter((file) => file.endsWith('.js'));

for (const file of eventFiles) {
	const filePath = path.join(eventsPath, file);
	const event = require(filePath);
	if (event.once) {
		client.once(event.name, (...args) => event.execute(...args));
	} else {
		client.on(event.name, (...args) => event.execute(...args));
	}
}

client.login(token);
```

You'll notice the code looks very similar to the command loading above it - read the files in the events folder and load each one individually.

The `Client` class in discord.js extends the [`EventEmitter`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_eventemitter) class. Therefore, the `client` object exposes the [`.on()`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_emitter_on_eventname_listener) and [`.once()`](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_emitter_once_eventname_listener) methods that you can use to register event listeners. These methods take two arguments: the event name and a callback function. These are defined in your separate event files as `name` and `execute`.

The callback function passed takes argument(s) returned by its respective event, collects them in an `args` array using the `...` [rest parameter syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters), then calls `event.execute()` while passing in the `args` array using the `...` [spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax). They are used here because different events in discord.js have different numbers of arguments. The rest parameter collects these variable number of arguments into a single array, and the spread syntax then takes these elements and passes them to the `execute` function.

After this, listening for other events is as easy as creating a new file in the `events` folder. The event handler will automatically retrieve and register it whenever you restart your bot.

<Callout>
	In most cases, you can access your `client` instance in other files by obtaining it from one of the other discord.js
	structures, e.g. `interaction.client` in the `interactionCreate` event. You do not need to manually pass it to your
	events.
