title: Slash Command Permissions
---

Slash commands have their own permissions system. This system allows you to set the default level of permissions required for a user to execute a command when it is first deployed or your bot is added to a new server.

The slash command permissions for guilds are defaults only and can be altered by guild administrators, allowing them to configure access however best suits their moderation and server roles. Your code should not try to enforce its own permission management, as this can result in a conflict between the server-configured permissions and your bot's code.

<Callout type="warn">
	It is **not possible to prevent users with Administrator permissions from using any commands deployed globally or
	specifically to their guild**. Think twice before creating "dev-only" commands such as `eval` and restrict them to
	your private, personal dev server.
</Callout>

## Member permissions

You can use `SlashCommandBuilder#setDefaultMemberPermissions` to set the default permissions required for a member to run the command. Setting it to `0` will hide the command from and prohibit anyone in a guild from using the command unless a specific overwrite is configured or the user has the Administrator permission flag.

For this, you'll introduce two common and simple moderation commands: `ban` and `kick`. For a ban command, a sensible default is to ensure that users already have the Discord permission `BanMembers` in order to use it.

```js title="commands/moderation/ban.js"
const { SlashCommandBuilder, PermissionFlagsBits } = require('discord.js');

const data = new SlashCommandBuilder()
	.setName('ban')
	.setDescription('Select a member and ban them.')
	.addUserOption((option) => option.setName('target').setDescription('The member to ban').setRequired(true))
	.setDefaultMemberPermissions(PermissionFlagsBits.BanMembers); // [!code ++]
```

For a kick command however, yout can allow members with the `KickMembers` permission to execute the command, so that's why the flag is listed here here.

<Callout>
	You can require the user to have all of multiple permissions by merging them with the `|` bitwise OR operator (for example `PermissionFlagsBits.BanMembers | PermissionFlagsBits.KickMembers`).
	You cannot require any of multiple permissions. Discord evaluates against the combined permission bitfield!

    If you want to learn more about the `|` bitwise OR operator you can check the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR) and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_OR) articles on the topic.

</Callout>

```js title="commands/moderation/kick.js"
const { SlashCommandBuilder, PermissionFlagsBits } = require('discord.js');

const data = new SlashCommandBuilder()
	.setName('kick')
	.setDescription('Select a member and kick them.')
	.addUserOption((option) => option.setName('target').setDescription('The member to kick').setRequired(true))
	.setDefaultMemberPermissions(PermissionFlagsBits.KickMembers);
```

In reality, you'll probably want to have an additional confirmation step before a ban actually executes. Check out the [button components section](../interactive-components/buttons) of the guide to see how to add confirmation buttons to your command responses, and listen to button clicks.

## Contexts

By default, globally-deployed commands are also available for use in DMs. You can pass in [InteractionContextType](https://discord-api-types.dev/api/discord-api-types-v10/enum/InteractionContextType) to the `setContexts` method of the builder to restrict the command to only be available in guilds or DMs.

It doesn't make much sense for your `ban` command to be available in DMs, so you can add `setContexts(InteractionContextType.Guild)` to the builder so that it is only available in guilds:

```js title="commands/moderation/ban.js"
const { InteractionContextType, PermissionFlagsBits, SlashCommandBuilder } = require('discord.js');

const data = new SlashCommandBuilder()
	.setName('ban')
	.setDescription('Select a member and ban them.')
	.addUserOption((option) => option.setName('target').setDescription('The member to ban').setRequired(true))
	.setDefaultMemberPermissions(PermissionFlagsBits.BanMembers)
	.setContexts(InteractionContextType.Guild); // [!code ++]
```

And that's all you need to know on slash command permissions and contexts!
