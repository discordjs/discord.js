With modals you can create pop-up forms that allow users to provide you with formatted inputs through submissions. We'll cover how to create, show, and receive modal forms using discord.js!

<Callout>
	This page is a follow-up to the [interactions (slash commands) page](../slash-commands/advanced-creation). Please
	carefully read that section first, so that you can understand the methods used in this section.
</Callout>

## Building and responding with modals

Unlike message components, modals aren't strictly components themselves. They're a callback structure used to respond to interactions.

<Callout>
	You can have a maximum of five `Label` or `Text Display` components per Modal. Similarly a `Label` must only contain
	one component.
</Callout>

To create a modal you construct a new `ModalBuilder`. You can then use the setters to add the custom id and title.

```js
const { Events, ModalBuilder } = require('discord.js');

client.on(Events.InteractionCreate, async (interaction) => {
	if (!interaction.isChatInputCommand()) return;

	if (interaction.commandName === 'ping') {
		const modal = new ModalBuilder().setCustomId('myModal').setTitle('My Modal');

		// TODO: Add components to modal...
	}
});
```

<Callout>
	The `customId` is a developer-defined string of up to 100 characters. Use this field to ensure you can uniquely define
	all incoming interactions from your modals.
</Callout>

The next step is to add a Modal components to the `modalBuilder`. Which users responding can enter free-text. Adding inputs is similar to adding components to messages.

At the end, we then call `ChatInputCommandInteraction#showModal` to display the modal to the user.

```js
const { Events, LabelBuilder, ModalBuilder, TextInputBuilder, TextInputStyle } = require('discord.js');

client.on(Events.InteractionCreate, async (interaction) => {
	if (!interaction.isChatInputCommand()) return;

	if (interaction.commandName === 'ping') {
		// Create the modal
		const modal = new ModalBuilder().setCustomId('myModal').setTitle('My Modal');

		// Create the Text Input components
		const favoriteColorInput = new TextInputBuilder()
			.setCustomId('favoriteColorInput')
			// Short means only a single line of text
			.setStyle(TextInputStyle.Short);

		const hobbiesInput = new TextInputBuilder()
			.setCustomId('hobbiesInput')
			// Paragraph means multiple lines of text.
			.setStyle(TextInputStyle.Paragraph)
			// Uninteractable text inside of the Text Input
			.setPlaceholder('card games, films, books, etc.');

		// Creating Labels for the Text Input components
		const favoriteColorLabel = new LabelBuilder()
			// The label is the prompt the user sees for this component
			.setLabel("What's your favorite color?")
			// Add the Text Input to the Label
			.setTextInputComponent(favoriteColorInput);

		const hobbiesLabel = new LabelBuilder()
			.setLabel("What's some of your favorite hobbies?")
			// The description is a small text under the Label and above the interactive component
			.setDescription('Activities you like to participate in')
			.setTextInputComponent(hobbiesInput);

		// Add Labels to the Modal
		modal.addLabelComponents(favoriteColorLabel, hobbiesLabel);

		// Show the modal to the user
		await interaction.showModal(modal); // [!code word:showModal]
	}
});
```

Restart your bot and invoke the `/ping` command again. You should see the modal as imaged below:

![Modal Example](./images/modal-example.png)

<Callout type="warn">
	Showing a modal must be the first response to an interaction. You cannot `deferReply()` or `deferUpdate()` then show a
	modal later.
</Callout>

## Receiving modal submissions

### Interaction collectors

Modal submissions can be collected within the scope of the interaction that showed it by utilising an `InteractionCollector`, or the `ChatInputCommandInteraction#awaitModalSubmit` promisified method. These both provide instances of the `ModalSubmitInteraction` class as collected items.

For a detailed guide on receiving message components via collectors, please refer to the [collectors guide](../popular-topics/collectors#interaction-collectors).

### The interactionCreate event

To receive a `ModalSubmitInteraction` event, attach an `Client#interactionCreate` event listener to your client and use the `BaseInteraction#isModalSubmit` type guard to make sure you only receive modals:

```js
client.on(Events.InteractionCreate, (interaction) => {
	if (!interaction.isModalSubmit()) return;
	console.log(interaction);
});
```

## Responding to modal submissions

The `ModalSubmitInteraction` class provides the same methods as the `ChatInputCommandInteraction` class. These methods behave equally:

- `reply()`
- `editReply()`
- `deferReply()`
- `fetchReply()`
- `deleteReply()`
- `followUp()`

If the modal was shown from a `ButtonInteraction` or `StringSelectMenuInteraction`, it will also provide these methods, which behave equally:

- `update()`
- `deferUpdate()`

```js
client.on(Events.InteractionCreate, async (interaction) => {
	if (!interaction.isModalSubmit()) return;
	if (interaction.customId === 'myModal') {
		await interaction.reply({ content: 'Your submission was received successfully!' });
	}
});
```

<Callout>
	If you're using typescript, you can use the `ModalSubmitInteraction#isFromMessage` type guard, to make sure the
	received interaction was from a `MessageComponentInteraction`.
</Callout>

## Extracting data from modal submissions

You'll most likely need to read the data sent by the user in the modal. You can do this by accessing the `ModalSubmitInteraction#fields`. From there you can call `ModalSubmitFields#getTextInputValue` with the custom id of the text input to get the value.

```js
client.on(Events.InteractionCreate, (interaction) => {
	if (!interaction.isModalSubmit()) return;
	if (interaction.customId === 'myModal') {
		await interaction.reply({ content: 'Your submission was received successfully!' });

		// Get the data entered by the user
		const favoriteColor = interaction.fields.getTextInputValue('favoriteColorInput');
		const hobbies = interaction.fields.getTextInputValue('hobbiesInput');

		console.log({ favoriteColor, hobbies });
	}
});
```

## Modal Components

### Text Input

### Input styles

Currently there are two different input styles available:

- `Short`, a single-line text entry;
- `Paragraph`, a multi-line text entry;

### Input properties

In addition to the `customId` and `style`, a text input can be customised in a number of ways to apply validation, prompt the user, or set default values via the `TextInputBuilder` methods:

```js
const input = new TextInputBuilder()
	// set the component id (this is not the custom id)
	.setId(0)
	// Set the maximum number of characters to allowed
	.setMaxLength(1_000)
	// Set the minimum number of characters required for submission
	.setMinLength(10)
	// Set a default value to pre-fill the Text Input
	.setValue('Default')
	// Require a value in this Text Input field (defaults to true)
	.setRequired(true);
```

### Text Display

Modals support adding a texts display. Unlike interactive components a Text Display is added to the modal builder, without being put in a Label first.

<Callout>
	Adding Text Display components decrees the number of Labels that can be added to the Modal. The Modal only has maximum
	of five `Label` or `Text Display` components.
</Callout>

```js
const modal = new ModalBuilder().setCustomId('myModal').setTitle('My Modal');

// Set the content of the Text Display
const text = new TextDisplayBuilder().setContent(
	"## Important Information\nAccording to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.",
);

// Add the Text Display to the Modal
modal.addTextDisplayComponents(text);
```

### Select Menus

Select Menus behave similarly in a Modals when compared to when in [Message components](../interactive-components/select-menus.mdx). There are two difference that Select Menus have when used in Modals First the when a sure makes a selection no Interaction event occurs. Second, `setRequired()` is used to indicate if a value is required in the Select Menu for submission

Follow example use a String Menu:

```js
const modal = new ModalBuilder().setCustomId('myModal').setTitle('My Modal');

const favoriteStarterSelect = new StringSelectMenuBuilder()
	.setCustomId('starter')
	.setPlaceholder('Make a selection!')
	.addOptions(
		// String select menu options
		new StringSelectMenuOptionBuilder()
			// Label displayed to user
			.setLabel('Bulbasaur')
			// Description of option
			.setDescription('The dual-type Grass/Poison Seed Pokémon.')
			// Value returned to in modal submission
			.setValue('bulbasaur'),
		new StringSelectMenuOptionBuilder()
			.setLabel('Charmander')
			.setDescription('The Fire-type Lizard Pokémon.')
			.setValue('charmander'),
		new StringSelectMenuOptionBuilder()
			.setLabel('Squirtle')
			.setDescription('The Water-type Tiny Turtle Pokémon.')
			.setValue('squirtle'),
	);

const favoriteStarterLabel = new LabelBuilder()
	.setLabel("What's some of your favorite Gen 1 Pokémon starter?")
	// The Description is small text under the label above the interactive component
	.setStringSelectMenuComponent(favoriteStarterSelect);

modal.setLabelComponents(favoriteStarterLabel);
```

### Extracting data from modal submissions

Unlike when used in a message or interaction reply select menus in a modal to not cause a `Client#InteractionCreate` event. Instead the selected menu values with be in the fields property of the modal submission interaction

<Callout>The get function will always return an array even if no values are selected</Callout>

```js
client.on(Events.InteractionCreate, (interaction) => {

	// [!code focus:3]
	if (!interaction.isModalSubmit()) return;
	if (interaction.customId === 'myModal') {
		const favoriteStarter = interaction.fields.getStringSelectValues('starter');

		await interaction.reply({ content: 'Your submission was received successfully!' });
		console.log(favoriteStarter);

	}
});
```
