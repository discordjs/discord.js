title: Collections

discord.js comes with a utility class known as `Collection`.
It extends JavaScript's native `Map` class, so it has all the `Map` features and more!

<Callout type="warn">
	If you're not familiar with `Map`, read [MDN's page on
	it](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) before continuing. You
	should be familiar with `Array`
	[methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) as well. We will
	also use some ES6 features, so read up [here](./es6-syntax) if you do not know what they are.
</Callout>

A `Map` allows for an association between unique keys and their values.
For example, how can you transform every value or filter the entries in a `Map` easily?
This is the point of the `Collection` class!

## Array-like Methods

Many of the methods on `Collection` correspond to their namesake in `Array`. One of them is `find`:

```js
// Assume we have an array of users and a collection of the same users.
array.find((u) => u.discriminator === '1000'); // [!code word:find]
collection.find((u) => u.discriminator === '1000');
```

The interface of the callback function is very similar between the two.
For arrays, callbacks usually pass the parameters `(value, index, array)`, where `value` is the value iterated to,
`index` is the current index, and `array` is the array. For collections, you would have `(value, key, collection)`.
Here, `value` is the same, but `key` is the key of the value, and `collection` is the collection itself instead.

Methods that follow this philosophy of staying close to the `Array` interface are as follows:

- `find`
- `filter` - Note that this returns a `Collection` rather than an `Array`.
- `map` - Yet this returns an `Array` of values instead of a `Collection`!
- `every`
- `some`
- `reduce`
- `concat`
- `sort`

## Converting to Array

Since `Collection` extends `Map`, it is an [iterable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols), and can be converted to an `Array` through either `Array.from()` or spread syntax (`...collection`).

```js
// For values.
Array.from(collection.values());
[...collection.values()];

// For keys.
Array.from(collection.keys());
[...collection.keys()];

// For [key, value] pairs.
Array.from(collection);
[...collection];
```

<Callout>
	Many people convert Collections to Arrays way too much!

    This can lead to unnecessary and confusing code. Before you use `Array.from()` or similar, ask yourself if whatever you are trying to do can't be done with the given `Map` or `Collection` methods or with a for-of loop. Not being familiar with a new data structure should not mean you default to transforming it into the other.

    There is usually a reason, why a `Map` or `Collection` is used. Most structures in Discord can be identified with an `id`, which lends itself well to `key -> value` associations like in `Map`s.

## Extra Utilities

Some methods are not from `Array` and are instead entirely new to standard JavaScript.

```js
// A random value.
collection.random();

// The first value.
collection.first();

// The first 5 values.
collection.first(5);

// Similar to `first`, but from the end.
collection.last();
collection.last(2);

// Removes anything that meets the condition from the collection.
// Sort of like `filter`, but in-place.
collection.sweep((user) => user.username === 'Bob');
```

A more complicated method is `partition`, which splits a single Collection into two new Collections based on the provided function.
You can think of it as two `filter`s, but done at the same time (and because of that much more performant):

```js
// `bots` is a Collection of users where their `bot` property was true.
// `humans` is a Collection where the property was false instead!
const [bots, humans] = collection.partition((u) => u.bot); // [!code word:partition]

// Both return true.
bots.every((b) => b.bot);
humans.every((h) => !h.bot); // note the "not" ! operator
```
