## About

`@discordjs/proxy-container` - Lightweight HTTP proxy for Discord's API, brought to you as a container ðŸ“¦

## Usage

Quickly spin up an instance:

`docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --name proxy -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 discordjs/proxy`

Use it:

```ts
import { Client } from 'discord.js';

const client = new Client({
	// other options,
	rest: {
		api: 'http://localhost:8080/api',
	},
});
```

Or with just `@discordjs/rest`:

```ts
import { REST } from '@discordjs/rest';

const rest = new REST({
	api: 'http://localhost:8080/api',
});
```

**Do note that you should not use the same proxy with multiple bots. We cannot guarantee you won't hit rate limits.
Webhooks with tokens or other requests that don't include the Authorization header are okay, though!**
