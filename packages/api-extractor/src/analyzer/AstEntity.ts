/**

 *
 * @remarks
 * Most of API Extractor's output is produced by using the using the `Span` utility to regurgitate strings from
 * the input .d.ts files.  If we need to rename an identifier, the `Span` visitor can pick out an interesting
 * node and rewrite its string, but otherwise the transformation operates on dumb text and not compiler concepts.
 * (Historically we did this because the compiler's emitter was an internal API, but it still has some advantages,
 * for example preserving syntaxes generated by an older compiler to avoid incompatibilities.)
 *
 * This strategy does not work for cases where the output looks very different from the input.  Today these
 * cases are always kinds of `import` statements, but that may change in the future.
