 * API Extractor tries to model the world as a collection of NPM packages, such that each
 * .d.ts file belongs to at most one package.  When API Extractor is invoked on a project,
 * we refer to that project as being the "working package".  There is exactly one
 * "working package" for the duration of this analysis.  Any files that do not belong to
 * the working package are referred to as "external":  external declarations belonging to
 * external packages.
 *
 * If API Extractor is invoked on a standalone .d.ts file, the "working package" may not
 * have an actual package.json file on disk, but we still refer to it in concept.
