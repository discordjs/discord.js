It also has support for newer Discord Features, such as emojis.\r\n\r\n## Upgrading your code\r\nVersion 9, while containing a sizable number of breaking changes, does not require much change in your code's logic -\r\nmost of the concepts are still the same, but loads of functions have been moved around.\r\nThe vast majority of methods you're used to using have been moved out of the Client class,\r\ninto other more relevant classes where they belong.\r\nBecause of this, you will need to convert most of your calls over to the new methods.\r\n\r\nHere are a few examples of methods that have changed:\r\n* `Client.sendMessage(channel, message)` ==> `TextChannel.sendMessage(message)`\r\n  * `Client.sendMessage(user, message)` ==> `User.sendMessage(message)`\r\n* `Client.updateMessage(message, \"New content\")` ==> `Message.edit(\"New Content\")`\r\n* `Client.getChannelLogs(channel, limit)` ==> `TextChannel.fetchMessages({options})`\r\n* `Server.detailsOfUser(User)` ==> `Server.members.get(User).properties` (retrieving a member gives a GuildMember object)\r\n* `Client.joinVoiceChannel(voicechannel)` => `VoiceChannel.join()`\r\n\r\nA couple more important details:\r\n* `Client.loginWithToken(\"token\")` ==> `client.login(\"token\")`\r\n* `Client.servers.length` ==> `client.guilds.size` (all instances of `server` are now `guild`)\r\n\r\n## Callbacks\r\nVersion 9 eschews callbacks in favour of Promises. This means all code relying on callbacks must be changed.  \r\nFor example, the following code:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclient.getChannelLogs(channel, 100, function(messages) {\r\n  console.log(`${messages.length} messages found`);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\nchannel.fetchMessages({limit: 100}).then(messages => {\r\n  console.log(`${messages.size} messages found`);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n"}],"examples":[{"category":"examples","name":"Ping Pong","data":"```js\n/*\n  A ping pong bot, whenever you send \"ping\", it replies \"pong\".\n*/\n\n// import the discord.js module\nconst Discord = require('discord.js');\n\n// create an instance of a Discord Client, and call it bot\nconst bot = new Discord.Client();\n\n// the token of your bot - https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me\nconst token = 'your bot token here';\n\n// the ready event is vital, it means that your bot will only start reacting to information\n// from Discord _after_ ready is emitted.\nbot.on('ready', () => {\n  console.log('I am ready!');\n});\n\n// create an event listener for messages\nbot.on('message', message => {\n  // if the message is \"ping\",\n  if (message.content === 'ping') {\n    // send \"pong\" to the same channel.\n    message.channel.sendMessage('pong');\n  }\n});\n\n// log our bot in\nbot.login(token);\n\n```"},{"category":"examples","name":"Avatars","data":"```js\n/*\n  Send a user a link to their avatar\n*/\n\n// import the discord.js module\nconst Discord = require('discord.js');\n\n// create an instance of a Discord Client, and call it bot\nconst bot = new Discord.Client();\n\n// the token of your bot - https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me\nconst token = 'your bot token here';\n\n// the ready event is vital, it means that your bot will only start reacting to information\n// from Discord _after_ ready is emitted.\nbot.on('ready', () => {\n  console.log('I am ready!');\n});\n\n// create an event listener for messages\nbot.on('message', message => {\n  // if the message is \"what is my avatar\",\n  if (message.content === 'what is my avatar') {\n    // send the user's avatar URL\n    message.reply(message.author.avatarURL);\n  }\n});\n\n// log our bot in\nbot.login(token);\n\n```"}]}}
