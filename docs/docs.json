Major methods, e.g. `client.sendMessage(channel, message)` have been moved\r\nfrom the Client class towards their respective classes - `textChannel.sendMessage(message)`. You can find out the full\r\nextent of these changes by looking at the classes in the documentation.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, some event names and parameters have changed - you should revisit these.\r\n"}],"examples":[{"category":"examples","name":"Ping Pong","data":"```js\n/*\n  A ping pong bot, whenever you send \"ping\", it replies \"pong\".\n*/\n\n// import the discord.js module\nconst Discord = require('discord.js');\n\n// create an instance of a Discord Client, and call it bot\nconst bot = new Discord.Client();\n\n// the token of your bot - https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me\nconst token = 'your bot token here';\n\n// the ready event is vital, it means that your bot will only start reacting to information\n// from Discord _after_ ready is emitted.\nbot.on('ready', () => {\n  console.log('I am ready!');\n});\n\n// create an event listener for messages\nbot.on('message', message => {\n  // if the message is \"ping\",\n  if (message.content === 'ping') {\n    // send \"pong\" to the same channel.\n    message.channel.sendMessage('pong');\n  }\n});\n\n// log our bot in\nbot.login(token);\n\n```"},{"category":"examples","name":"Avatars","data":"```js\n/*\n  Send a user a link to their avatar\n*/\n\n// import the discord.js module\nconst Discord = require('discord.js');\n\n// create an instance of a Discord Client, and call it bot\nconst bot = new Discord.Client();\n\n// the token of your bot - https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me\nconst token = 'your bot token here';\n\n// the ready event is vital, it means that your bot will only start reacting to information\n// from Discord _after_ ready is emitted.\nbot.on('ready', () => {\n  console.log('I am ready!');\n});\n\n// create an event listener for messages\nbot.on('message', message => {\n  // if the message is \"what is my avatar\",\n  if (message.content === 'what is my avatar') {\n    // send the user's avatar URL\n    message.reply(message.author.avatarURL);\n  }\n});\n\n// log our bot in\nbot.login(token);\n\n```"}]}}
